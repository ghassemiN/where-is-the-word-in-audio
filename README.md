## Where is the word in audio 

It was interesting for me to know if it is possible to find out, without listening to the audio file, whether the word we want is included in the audio or not, I mean in what time of the file! I did a search and found out how an audio file is converted to text. Then all I did was add the search section and calculate the approximate time.
So all you need is a wav file, and a word to looking for.
